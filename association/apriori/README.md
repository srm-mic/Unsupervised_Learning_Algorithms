## Apriori Algorithm

Apriori is used for frequent itemset mining over relational databases. It uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties.

Some terms we need to know before implementing Apriori:

Consider items I1 and I2 in a dataset consisting of transactions with the corresponding items bought:
- Support (I1): Ratio between the number of transactions containing the item by the total number of transactions 

- Confidence (I1 => I2): Total number of transactions containing both items I1 and I2 divided by the total number of transactions containing I1.

- Lift (I1 => I2): Ratio between confidence and support

- Frequent Itemset: An itemset whose support value is greater than a given minimum support value.


### How does it work?

Apriori says that: 

- All subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent.
- If an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets will be infrequent.

Apriori determines k-itemsets (starting with 1) at each step then checks if it is a frequent itemset or not. This includes finding the subsets ot the itemset and ensuring that those are frequent as well. 

This goes on until the most frequent itemset is reached.

### Example
In the image shown below, our datasets consists of 5 transactions containing some items. 

The first itemset is formed by grouping one item. The itemset {4} has a support value less than the given minimum support value (i.e 2), hence it is eliminated. 

This process is repeated to until no more frequent itemsets can be formed.

### Usage guidelines

To run the algorithm, follow these steps: 

- Open your terminal and clone the repository

        git clone https://github.com/sashrika15/Unsupervised_Learning_Algorithms

- Change to apriori directory

        cd association/apriori

- Run test file

        python test.py
        
### Result from implementation

Apriori algorithm can go on to find frequent itemsets for many sets of items. In this implementation, we are only finding frequent itemsets for pairs.
