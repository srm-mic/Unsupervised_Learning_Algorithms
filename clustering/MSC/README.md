<h1>What is Mean Shift Clustering</h1>
MSC is a centroid based clustering algorithm which iteratively updates centroid in the data till blobs are discovered in the sample provided. It is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm works on the concept of Kernel Density Estimation known as KDE. It is also known as mode seeking algorithm.
This algorithm is mostly used for computer vision and image segmentation.

Mean-Shift algorithm basically assigns the datapoints to the clusters iteratively by shifting points towards the highest density of datapoints i.e. cluster centroid.

Basically it is a straightforward approach which primarily used to solve problems related to image segmentation, clustering. It is comparatively slower than K-Means and it is computationally expensive.

## Guidelines to use the code and obtain the graphs 
- Clone the Repository and enter the appropriate directory: 

        git clone https://github.com/sashrika15/Unsupervised_Learning_Algorithms

- Entering the MSC directory: 

        cd clustering/MSC
        
- Setting up the Python Environment with dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

- Running the file:

        python3 test.py
