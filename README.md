### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

A one-stop for unsupervised learning algorithms implemented from scratch in python.

This repository is meant to be a place to study algorithms thoroughly and learn how to implement the theoretical concept. While there are libraries available like scikit-learn which can be used to import implementable models, using them can lead to a gap in understanding of the algorithm itself. 

Take the time, learn your algorithm and code!

### Types of Algorithms

This repository is specfically for unsupervised learning algorithms _only_.
These algorithms are usually used to solve some specific types of problems:

1. **Clustering**: Finding structures or patterns in a collection of uncategorized data.

2. **Association**: Discovering rules which describe relationships in your data.

3. **Component Analysis**: This is a broad category in which I have clubbed algorithms for dimensionality reduction like PCA.
